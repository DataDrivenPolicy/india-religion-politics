This exemplifies a more complex query, used to extract the raw data
for my 2014 EPW piece (with Raheel Dhattiwala) on Muslim votebanks in
UP and Gujarat. Note that the authoritative replication data for this
paper is at https://dx.doi.org/10.4119/unibi/2694082 (we wrote it
before I consolidated everything here on GitHub). 

In the authoritative replication data, some of the variables will
vary, namely the station_ids. Also,  the R script with our model and
data on riots are only included there there. So do not expect to be
able to re-generate the exact same base data from here.

The essence of this data can be extracted from here, though, using
epw2014.sql - see it as an example in complex SQL queries...
