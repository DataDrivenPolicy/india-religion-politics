This is basically a generic example of how to create maps of religious
demography. In the SAMAJ article, we used this as the base layer for
the map of 'Muslim Lucknow', then added the river line from
OpenStreetMap, cut the city area out using the MODIS polygon and added
haj pilgrims from my private data collection.

I leave these refinements to the reader to figure out, but to get the
baselayer of Muslim demography out of this dataset, it takes 4 steps:

a) run samaj2015.sql against the main SQLite database to create
samaj2015.csv (adjust the SELECT statement for diff. cities etc)

b) run ogr2ogr samaj2015.shp samaj2015.vrt to create point shapefile

c) use QGIS (or more precisely their voronoi plugin) to transform said
point shapefile into an area representation 

d) make a cloropleth of that area shapefile (with QGIS, Tilemill, etc)
