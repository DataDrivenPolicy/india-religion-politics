This describes the steps to reproduce in principle the segregation analysis in my EPA restudy of Jaffrelot's and Gayer's "Muslims in Indian cities". 

For license reason I cannot share the proprietary 'city' boundary layer, but the 'built' boundary can be reproduced (it is basically the 10m urban areas polygon from http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-urban-area/). I am happy to provide access to the city layer on an individual (and academic-only) basis - just drop me an email.

Also, the paper calculates indices on station-by-station (rather than booth-by-booth) basis. This dataset does not contain the station classification for states other than UP and Gujarat, so I base this replication instruction on the booth level. It should result in very similar D(M), though, given that D(M) accounts for spatial proximity of units of measurement. So in that sense, too, this is more of a howto-guide than strictly speaking replication data. Again, I am happy to provide the actual replication data on an individual (and academic-only) basis, though - just drop me an email.

In any case, these are the steps to reproduce my analysis:

1) run epa2017.sql against the main SQLite database to extract one CSV per city

2) adjust epa2017.vrt for each city and run ogr2ogr to create point ESRI shapefiles (as described in the samaj2015 example)

3) use QGIS to convert each point baselayer into an area representation using the voronoi plugin

4) use QGIS to cut each baselayer with the relevant boundary shapefile (ie the naturalearth polygon mentioned above) and save the results in the respective city shapefile referenced below; also save the boundary polygon in combined-borders.shp

5) finally run epa2017.sh, which basically sets up a GRASS environment and then runs epa2017.R which does the actual weightlifting

The segregation indices will then be calculated and output into epa2017-results.csv.
